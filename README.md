# Pixelazion

This under development experimental project is being made with Fontra https://fontra.xyz

It is making intensive use of Variable Components used as 'pixels' to shape the letterforms.

Watch the video here: [Pixelazion video](https://github.com/BlackFoundryCom/pixelazion/blob/main/documentation/Pixelazion.mp4)

Support for Variable Components in binary fonts is still under development, and we are working hard to also be able to flatten the variable components into traditional Variable Fonts (it already works for most situations, but we run into some challenges in this particularly experimental project).


# Build

To build the font, run in the Terminal:

`source setupvenv.sh`

then:

`sh export_and_build.sh`
